# La Argentina Tourism
I took a training course in PHP with MySQL during my summer break in 2016. As a part of a final evaluation, with 2 team members we created a website to explore Argentina, book accommodations and transport tickets.

Please note:

-The database we used is MySQL using the software XAMPP.
